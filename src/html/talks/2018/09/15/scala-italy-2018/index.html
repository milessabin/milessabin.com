    # What is kind polymorphism?

    It's a form of parametric polymorphism

    ```
    // Given ...
    trait List[T]
    
    // ... we can subsititute for T
    List[Int]
    List[String]
    List[Boolean]
    ```
    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    It's a form of parametric polymorphism

    ```
    // Given ...
    trait List[`T`] // T is of kind *
    
    // ... we can subsititute for T
    List[Int]
    List[String]
    List[Boolean]
    ```

    We say type parameters of this sort are of _kind `*`_

    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    It's a form of parametric polymorphism

    ```
    // Given ...
    trait Functor[F[_]]
    
    // ... we can subsititute for F
    Functor[List]
    Functor[Option]
    Functor[Vector]
    ```
    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    It's a form of parametric polymorphism

    ```
    // Given ...
    trait Functor[`F[_]`] // F is of kind *->*
    
    // ... we can subsititute for F
    Functor[List]
    Functor[Option]
    Functor[Vector]
    ```

    We say type parameters of this sort are of _kind `*->*`_

    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    It's a form of parametric polymorphism

    ```
    // Given ...
    trait TypeTag[???]

    // ... we want to subsititute
    TypeTag[Int]  // argument of kind *
    TypeTag[List] // argument of kind *->*
    TypeTag[Map]  // argument of kind *->*->*
    ```
    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    It's a form of parametric polymorphism

    ```
    // Given ...
    trait TypeTag[`???`]

    // ... we want to subsititute
    TypeTag[`Int`]  // argument of kind *
    TypeTag[`List`] // argument of kind *->*
    TypeTag[`Map`]  // argument of kind *->*->*
    ```

    Can we substitute types of different kinds at the same position?

    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    Haskellers can do things like this with `-XPolyKinds`

    ```
    data Proxy t = Proxy

    class Typeable t where
    typeOf :: Proxy t -> TypeRep

    instance Typeable Int  where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    instance Typeable []   where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    ```
    ---
    # What is kind polymorphism?

    Haskellers can do things like this with `-XPolyKinds`

    ```
    data Proxy t = Proxy

    class Typeable `t` where
    typeOf :: Proxy t -> TypeRep

    instance Typeable `Int`  where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    instance Typeable `[]`   where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    ```

    Instances of `Typeable` for both `Int` (`*`) and `[]` (`*->*`)

    # Why kind polymorphism?

    Boilerplate elimination

    ```
    data Proxy t = Proxy

    class Typeable t where
    typeOf :: Proxy t -> TypeRep




    instance Typeable  Int  where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    instance Typeable  []   where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    ```
    ---
    # Why kind polymorphism?

    Boilerplate elimination

    ```


    class Typeable (t :: *) where
    typeOf :: t -> TypeRep

    class Typeable1 (t :: * -> *) where
      typeOf1 :: t a -> TypeRep

    instance Typeable  Int  where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    instance Typeable1 []   where typeOf _ = TypeRep
    ```

    Without kind polymorphism we need to manually duplicate definitions for each kind we want to support

    ---
    # Why kind polymorphism?

    ClassTag, TypeTag

      ```
      typeOf[List[Any]] // Fully applied type, .typeConstructor to get List

      typeOf[List[_]]   // An existential type

      typeOf[List]      // What we really want
      ```

    shapeless has a `Typeable` similar to Haskell's

    ---
    # Why kind polymorphism?

    Is that sufficiently compelling?

    What's so bad about a bit of boilerplate?

    --

    For the examples so far, maybe not so much, and not a lot.

    Let's try another example ...

    # Generic programming with shapeless

    # Generic programming with shapeless

    shapeless is a Scala generic programming library

    It allows ADTs to be manipulated in a very general way

    &mdash; compile time generic representation

    &mdash; _not_ runtime reflection.

    It does this mainly via normal, though "advanced", Scala code

    &mdash; implicit induction, path dependent and singleton types

    It has one very important Scala macro primitive ...
    ---
    # Generic programming with shapeless

    `Generic` is a type class which for suitable types `G` defines
      * a representation type `Repr`
      * an operation `to` which maps a `G` to a `Repr` value
      * an operation `from` which maps a `Repr` to a `G` value

    ```
    trait Generic[G] {
      type Repr
      def to(t: G): Repr
      def from(t: Repr): G
    }
    ```
    ---
    # Generic programming with shapeless

    An implicit macro provides instances of `Generic` when needed

    shapeless provides a toolkit for manipulating the generic representation

    ```
    def concat[A: Generic, B: Generic, C: Generic](a: A, b: B): C =
      Generic[C].from(Generic[A].to(a) ++ Generic[B].to(b))

    case class A(i: Int, s: String)
    case class B(b: Boolean)
    case class C(i: Int, s: String, b: Boolean)

    val c = concat(A(23, "foo"), B(true)) // C(23, "foo", true)
    ```

    Fully statically type checked, no runtime reflection

    GHC's Generics feature is similar and was an inspiration

    ---
    # Generic programming with shapeless

    shapeless initially only represented types of kind `*`
    
    &mdash; fully applied, complete types like `Option[Int]`

    --
    
    &mdash; visible immediately in the type parameters and their uses ...

    ```
    trait Generic[G, Repr] {
      def to(t: G): Repr
      def from(t: Repr): G
    }
    ```

      def from(t: Repr): `G`
    }
    ```

    &mdash; this covers a lot of ground

    # Generic programming with shapeless

    support for representing types of kind `*->*` came later

    &mdash; type constructors with a single type argument like `List` or `Option`

    --

    &mdash; again, visible immediately in the type parameters/uses ...

    ```
    trait Generic1[G[_], Repr[_]] {

    `FunctorK` (aka `HFunctor` in Haskell) is a proposed type class for Cats

    )

    * The kind of `Order` is `(*->*)->*` &mdash; (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)

    ---
    
    The problems &mdash;

    + A proliferation of `GenericX` type classes which differ only in the the kinds of their arguments

    --

    + Dotty/Scala 3 will take a very different approach to meta programming
      + Ideally we'd replace the macros with a language intrinsic

    --

    + The repetition is just barely tolerable in a library &mdash; but completely unacceptable as a language primitive

    # Can we abstract away the differences?

    ---
    # Can we abstract away the differences?

    The first hurdle ...
    
    There's _nowhere_ in a Scala program you can put types of different kinds

    ```
    trait Generic[G, Repr] ...

    Generic[List[Int], ListRepr[Int]] // OK
    Generic[List, ListRepr]           // Nope

    trait Generic[G[_], Repr[_]]

    Generic[List[Int], ListRepr[Int]] // Nope
    Generic[List, ListRepr]           // OK
    ```

    ---
    # Can we abstract away the differences?

    We can try and encode our way out of this

    We represent kinds via a family of type constructors,
    ```
    trait K0[T]      // List[Int] -> K0[List[Int]]
    trait K1[F[_]]   // List      -> K1[List]
    ...
    ```

    --

    And then type application via a GADT,

    ```
    sealed trait Apply[O, I]
    case class Apply0[T, I](value: T) extends Apply[K0[T], I]
    case class Apply1[F[_], I](value: F[I]) extends Apply[K1[F], I]
    ...

    Apply0[K0[List[Int], Nothing]]
    Apply1[K1[List], T]
    ```

    ---
    # Can we abstract away the differences?
    
    This gives us a `Generic` which looks like

    ```
    trait Generic[G, Repr] {
      def to[I](t: Apply[G, I]): Apply[Repr, I]
      def from[I](t: Apply[Repr, I]): Apply[G, I]
    }

    Generic[K0[List[Int]] K0[ListRepr[Int]]]

    # Can we go further?

    + Poly-kinded type application is the second hurdle

    ```
    trait Generic[`G` <: AnyKind, `Repr` <: KindOf[G]] {
      def to[`I`](t: G[`I`]): Repr[`I`]
      def from[`I`](t: Repr[`I`]): G[`I`]
    }

    implicit object BoxGeneric extends Generic[Box, BoxRepr] {

            
            
      def to[T](t: Box[T]): BoxRepr[T] = (t.contents, ())
      def from[T](r: BoxRepr[T]): Box[T] = Box(r._1)
    }
    ```

    Semantically the type parameters have to match the kinds of the types that
    are applied to them.

    Erasure is our friend here.

    }
    ```

    We most likely end up with bridge methods similar to the encoding

    # Current status

    + Typelevel Scala prototype

    + Initial Dotty implementation

    + Backport from Dotty to Lightbend Scala

    + Experiment with poly-kinded application

    + SIP!
