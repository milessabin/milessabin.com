Whoops! Binary compatibility was broken in 1.0.3 and again in 1.0.6. <span class="break"></span> In version 1.0.7
binary compatability with 1.0.3-5 has been restored and 1.0.6 is now deprecated. The binary compatibility breaking
changes have been moved to 1.1.0 and hopefully the addition of [MiMa][mima] to the build will make a recurrence of
this sort of breakage much less likely in future.

Release notes follow ...

Surely you want some "yada yada" in here too.
