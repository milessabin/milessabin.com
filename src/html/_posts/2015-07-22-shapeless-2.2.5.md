Another day, another shapeless release. This time Scala 2.12.0-M2 support, coproduct `foldLeft`, some `Coproduct` and
`Generic` documentation and some tweaks to the build ...

<span class="break"></span>

This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.5][shapeless].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.2.4.
shapeless 2.2.5 is source and binary compatible with shapeless 2.2.0+
and should be binary compatible with shapeless-2.1.0 in most cases.

* shapeless is now compatible with Scala 2.12.0-M2. Many thanks to
  [Jason Zaugg][retronym] for his assistance.

* An implementation of `foldLeft` for coproducts has been contributed
  by Andreas Koestler.

* Some much needed documentation for `Coproduct` and `Generic` has
  been contributed by [Bryn Keller][brynkeller].

* JDK 6 has been moved from the main Travis build matrix to a separate
  branch (jdk6-canary) and all published shapeless branches are built
  against JDK 8.

* A build validation SBT command alias was contributed by
  [Frank Thomas][fst].

Many thanks everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and
encouragement.
