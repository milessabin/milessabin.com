This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.3][shapeless].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.2.2.
shapeless 2.2.3 is source and binary compatible with shapeless 2.2.0+
and should be binary compatible with shapeless-2.1.0 in most cases.

The changes are,

* Generic1 now supports nested type constructors.

* Added an Adjoin type class which [flattens][router] HLists and
  Coproducts by one layer (thanks to Travis Brown).

* Fixed an incompatibility between cachedImplicit and the orphan type
  class derivation mechanism ([#391][issue-391]).

Contributors for shapeless 2.2.3 are,

* Travis Brown ([@travisbrown](https://twitter.com/travisbrown))

Many thanks to all of you and everyone else who has contributed ideas,
enthusiasm and encouragement.
